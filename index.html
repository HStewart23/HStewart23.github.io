   <div> <p> When I tell people that I am applying for this course they are usually surprised because I am a lit/phil graduate and <span class = "red"> normal people donâ€™t associate humanities with programming </span>. Well, more people should. In Literature and Philosophy I studied patterns of oppression as they are reflected in language and the immense <span class = "red"> power of infrastructure and technology when it comes to segregation and social control </span>. How could I, someone who is so engaged with these things, not be interested in these issues on a grass roots level?
