 <div id = "page2">
   <p> As a literature/ philosophy graduate, I am not exactly what you visualise when you think of a programmer. I want to change this because I believe being concerned about the workings of the world and understanding the language of change are occupations that have an obvious link. Literature and philosophy gave me a social conscience and deepened my curiosity about the world. What they couldn't really do is give me the power to change anything. Instead my studies taught me about things like political apathy, institutionalised gender inequality and broken education systems and left me feeling helpless to change any of these things. For me, programming is emancipatory and the reason that I am applying to Founders and Coders is that I feel like you share this vision.   </p>

       <p> The way that I visualise using the skills I could potentially gain from the Founders and Coders program is building things for people who are trying to make a change. The project that you show on your website with students building a web app to aid something to do with mental health is very exciting to me and I find it encouraging that the NHS is one of your associated companies. Alternately, I have previously worked for  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GEMovement">‘The Global Education Movement’ (GEM) </a> and found the problems surrounding education to be equally engaging so developing web apps in that field would also be of interest to me. As far as I have found you are the only course which really focuses on the social good that can be done with code and for that reason I hope that you consider my application. </p>
